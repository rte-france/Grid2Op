        powerline (no unit)

    topo_vect: :class:`numpy.ndarray`, dtype:int
        For each object (load, generator, ends of a powerline) it gives on which bus this object is connected
        in its substation. See :func:`grid2op.Backend.Backend.get_topo_vect` for more information.

    line_status: :class:`numpy.ndarray`, dtype:bool
        Gives the status (connected / disconnected) for every powerline (``True`` at position `i` means the powerline
        `i` is connected)

    timestep_overflow: :class:`numpy.ndarray`, dtype:int
        Gives the number of time steps since a powerline is in overflow.

    time_before_cooldown_line: :class:`numpy.ndarray`, dtype:int
        For each powerline, it gives the number of time step the powerline is unavailable due to "cooldown"
        (see :attr:`grid2op.Parameters.Parameters.NB_TIMESTEP_COOLDOWN_LINE` for more information). 0 means the
        an action will be able to act on this same powerline, a number > 0 (eg 1) means that an action at this time step
        cannot act on this powerline (in the example the agent have to wait 1 time step)

    time_before_cooldown_sub: :class:`numpy.ndarray`, dtype:int
        Same as :attr:`BaseObservation.time_before_cooldown_line` but for substations. For each substation, it gives the
        number of timesteps to wait before acting on this substation (see
        see :attr:`grid2op.Parameters.Parameters.NB_TIMESTEP_COOLDOWN_SUB` for more information).

    time_next_maintenance: :class:`numpy.ndarray`, dtype:int
        For each powerline, it gives the time of the next planned maintenance. For example if there is:

            - `1` at position `i` it means that the powerline `i` will be disconnected for maintenance operation at
              the next time step.
            - `0` at position `i` means that powerline `i` is disconnected from the powergrid for maintenance operation
              at the current time step.
            - `-1` at position `i` means that powerline `i` will not be disconnected for maintenance reason for this
              episode.
            - `k` > 1 at position `i` it means that the powerline `i` will be disconnected for maintenance operation at
              in `k` time steps

        When a powerline is "in maintenance", it cannot be reconnected by the `Agent` before the end of this
        maintenance.

    duration_next_maintenance: :class:`numpy.ndarray`, dtype:int
        For each powerline, it gives the number of time step that the maintenance will last (if any). This means that,
        if at position `i` of this vector:

            - there is a `0`: the powerline is not disconnected from the grid for maintenance
            - there is a `1`, `2`, ... the powerline will be disconnected for at least `1`, `2`, ... timestep (**NB**
              in all case, the powerline will stay disconnected until a :class:`grid2op.BaseAgent.BaseAgent` performs the
              proper :class:`grid2op.BaseAction.BaseAction` to reconnect it).

        When a powerline is "in maintenance", it cannot be reconnected by the `Agent` before the end of this
        maintenance.

    target_dispatch: :class:`numpy.ndarray`, dtype:float
        For **each** generators, it gives the target redispatching, asked by the agent. This is the sum of all
        redispatching asked by the agent for during all the episode. It for each generator it is a number between:
        - pmax and pmax. Note that there is information about all generators there, even the one that are not
        dispatchable.

    actual_dispatch: :class:`numpy.ndarray`, dtype:float
        For **each** generators, it gives the redispatching currently implemented by the environment.
        Indeed, the environment tries to implement at best the :attr:`BaseObservation.target_dispatch`, but sometimes,
        due to physical limitation (pmin, pmax, ramp min and ramp max) it cannot. In this case, only the best possible
        redispatching is implemented at the current time step, and this is what this vector stores. Note that there is
        information about all generators there, even the one that are not
        dispatchable.

    target_flex: :class:`numpy.ndarray`, dtype:float
        For **each** load, it gives the target flexibility, asked by the agent. This is the sum of all
        fleixiblity asked by the agent for during all the episode. For each load it is a number between:
        - size and 0. Note that there is information about all generators there, even the one that are not
        flexible.

    actual_flex: :class:`numpy.ndarray`, dtype:float
        For **each** load, it gives the flexibility currently implemented by the environment.
        Indeed, the environment tries to implement at best the :attr:`BaseObservation.target_flex`, but sometimes,
        due to physical limitation (size, ramp min and ramp max) it cannot. In this case, only the best possible
        fleixiblity is implemented at the current time step, and this is what this vector stores. Note that there is
        information about all generators there, even the one that are notflexible.

    storage_charge: :class:`numpy.ndarray`, dtype:float
        The actual 'state of charge' of each storage unit, expressed in MWh.

    storage_power_target: :class:`numpy.ndarray`, dtype:float
        For each storage units, give the setpoint of production / consumption as given by the agent

    storage_power: :class:`numpy.ndarray`, dtype:float
        Give the actual storage production / loads at the given state.

    storage_theta: :class:`numpy.ndarray`, dtype:float
        The voltage angle (in degree) of the bus to which each storage units
        is connected. Only availble if the backend supports the retrieval of
        voltage angles (see :attr:`BaseObservation.support_theta`).

    gen_p_before_curtail:  :class:`numpy.ndarray`, dtype:float
        Give the production of renewable generator there would have been
        if no curtailment were applied (**NB** it returns 0.0 for non renewable
        generators that cannot be curtailed)

    curtailment_limit: :class:`numpy.ndarray`, dtype:float
        Limit (in ratio of gen_pmax) imposed on each renewable generator as set by the agent.

        It is always 1. if no curtailment actions is acting on the generator.
        
        This is the "curtailment" given in the action by the agent.

    curtailment_limit_effective: :class:`numpy.ndarray`, dtype:float
        Limit (in ratio of gen_pmax) imposed on each renewable generator effectively imposed by the environment.

        It matches :attr:`BaseObservation.curtailment_limit` if `param.LIMIT_INFEASIBLE_CURTAILMENT_STORAGE_ACTION`
        is ``False`` (default) otherwise the environment is able to limit the curtailment actions if too much
        power would be needed to compensate the "loss" of generation due to renewables.

        It is always 1. if no curtailment actions is acting on the generator.

    curtailment_mw: :class:`numpy.ndarray`, dtype:float
        Gives the amount of power curtailed for each generator (it is 0. for all
        non renewable generators)
        
        This is NOT the "curtailment" given in the action by the agent.

    curtailment: :class:`numpy.ndarray`, dtype:float
        Give the power curtailed for each generator. It is expressed in
        ratio of gen_pmax (so between 0. - meaning no curtailment in effect for this
        generator - to 1.0 - meaning this generator should have produced pmax, but
        a curtailment action limits it to 0.)

        This is NOT the "curtailment" given in the action by the agent.
        
    current_step: ``int``
        Current number of step performed up until this observation (NB this is not given in the observation if
        it is transformed into a vector)

    max_step: ``int``
        Maximum number of steps possible for this episode

    delta_time: ``float``
        Time (in minutes) between the last step and the current step (usually constant in an episode, even in an environment)

    is_alarm_illegal: ``bool``
        whether the last alarm has been illegal (due to budget constraint). It can only be ``True`` if an alarm
        was raised by the agent on the previous step. Otherwise it is always ``False`` (warning: /!\\\\ Only valid with "l2rpn_icaps_2021" environment /!\\\\)

    time_since_last_alarm: ``int``
        Number of steps since the last successful alarm has been raised. It is `-1` if no alarm has been raised yet. (warning: /!\\\\ Only valid with "l2rpn_icaps_2021" environment /!\\\\)

    last_alarm: :class:`numpy.ndarray`, dtype:int
        For each zones, gives how many steps since the last alarm was raised successfully for this zone (warning: /!\\\\ Only valid with "l2rpn_icaps_2021" environment /!\\\\)

    attention_budget: ``int``
        The current attention budget

    was_alarm_used_after_game_over: ``bool``
        Was the last alarm used to compute anything related
        to the attention budget when there was a game over. It can only be set to ``True`` if the observation
        corresponds to a game over, but not necessarily. (warning: /!\\\\ Only valid with "l2rpn_icaps_2021" environment /!\\\\)

    gen_margin_up: :class:`numpy.ndarray`, dtype:float
        From how much can you increase each generators production between this
        step and the next.

        It is always 0. for non renewable generators. For the others it is defined as
        `np.minimum(type(self).gen_pmax - self.gen_p, self.gen_max_ramp_up)`

    gen_margin_down: :class:`numpy.ndarray`, dtype:float
        From how much can you decrease each generators production between this
        step and the next.

        It is always 0. for non renewable generators. For the others it is defined as
        `np.minimum(self.gen_p - type(self).gen_pmin, self.gen_max_ramp_down)`

    active_alert: :class:`numpy.ndarray`, dtype:bool
        .. warning:: Only available if the environment supports the "alert" feature (*eg* "l2rpn_idf_2023"). 
        
        .. seealso:: :ref:`grid2op-alert-module` section of the doc for more information
        
        .. versionadded:: 1.9.1
        
        This attribute gives the lines "under alert" at the given observation.
        It is only relevant for the "real" environment and not for `obs.simulate` nor `obs.get_forecast_env`
        
    time_since_last_alert: :class:`numpy.ndarray`, dtype:int
        .. warning:: Only available if the environment supports the "alert" feature (*eg* "l2rpn_idf_2023").

        .. versionadded:: 1.9.1
        
        Give the time since an alert has been raised for each powerline. If you just raise an
        alert for attackable line `i` then obs.time_since_last_alert[i] = 0 (and counter
        increase by 1 each step).
        
        If attackable line `i` has never been "under alert" then obs.time_since_last_alert[i] = -1
        
    alert_duration: :class:`numpy.ndarray`, dtype:int
        .. warning:: Only available if the environment supports the "alert" feature (*eg* "l2rpn_idf_2023"). 
        
        .. seealso:: :ref:`grid2op-alert-module` section of the doc for more information
        
        .. versionadded:: 1.9.1
        
        Give the time since an alert has started for all attackable line. If you just raise an
        alert for attackable line `i` then obs.time_since_last_alert[i] = 1 and this counter
        increase by 1 each step as long as the agent continues to "raise an alert on attackable line i"
        
        When the attackable line `i` is not under an alert then obs.time_since_last_alert[i] = 0
        
    total_number_of_alert: :class:`numpy.ndarray`, dtype:int
        .. warning:: Only available if the environment supports the "alert" feature (*eg* "l2rpn_idf_2023"). 
        
        .. seealso:: :ref:`grid2op-alert-module` section of the doc for more information
        
        .. versionadded:: 1.9.1
        
        This attribute stores, since the beginning of the current episode, the total number
        of alerts (here 1 alert = one alert for 1 powerline for 1 step) sent by the agent.
        
    time_since_last_attack: :class:`numpy.ndarray`, dtype:int
        .. warning:: Only available if the environment supports the "alert" feature (*eg* "l2rpn_idf_2023"). 
        
        .. seealso:: :ref:`grid2op-alert-module` section of the doc for more information
        
        .. versionadded:: 1.9.1
        
        Similar to `time_since_last_alert` but for the attack.
        
        For each attackable line `i` it counts the number of steps since the powerline has
        been attacked:
        
        - obs.time_since_last_attack[i] = -1 then attackable line `i` has never been attacked
        - obs.time_since_last_attack[i] = 0 then attackable line `i` has been attacked "for the
          first time" this step
        - obs.time_since_last_attack[i] = 1 then attackable line `i` has been attacked "for the
          first time" the previous step
        - obs.time_since_last_attack[i] = 2 then attackable line `i` has been attacked "for the
          first time" 2 steps ago
          
        .. note::
            An attack "for the first time" is NOT an attack "for the first time of the scenario".
            Indeed, for this attribute, if a powerline is under attack for say 5 consecutive steps,
            then the opponent stops its attack on this line and says 6 or 7 steps later it
            start again to attack it then obs.time_since_last_attack[i] = 0 at the "first time" the 
            opponent attacks again this powerline.
        
    was_alert_used_after_attack: :class:`numpy.ndarray`, dtype:int
        .. warning:: Only available if the environment supports the "alert" feature (*eg* "l2rpn_idf_2023"). 
        
        .. danger:: 
           This attribute is only filled
           if you use a compatible reward (*eg* :class:`grid2op.Reward.AlertReward`)
           as the main reward (or a "combined" reward with this reward being part of it)

        .. versionadded:: 1.9.1
        
        For each attackable line `i` it says:
        
        - obs.was_alert_used_after_attack[i] = 0 => attackable line i has not been attacked
        - obs.was_alert_used_after_attack[i] = -1 => attackable line i has been attacked and for the last attack
          the INCORRECT alert was sent (meaning that: if the agent survives, it sends an alert
          and if the agent died it fails to send an alert)
        - obs.was_alert_used_after_attack[i] = +1 => attackable line i has been attacked and for the last attack
          the CORRECT alert was sent (meaning that: if the agent survives, it did not send an alert
          and if the agent died it properly sent an alert)

        By "last attack", we mean the last attack that occured until now.

        - obs.attack_under_alert[i] = -1 => attackable line i has been attacked and (before

            - if a storage unit is inspected, information are:

                - "storage_power": the power the unit actually produced / absorbed
                - "storage_charge": the state of the charge of the storage unit

                - "storage_theta": (optional) the voltage angle of the bus at which the storage unit is connected
                - "bus": the bus (1 or 2) to which the storage unit is connected
                - "sub_id" : the id of the substation to which the sotrage unit is connected

            - if a substation is inspected, it returns the topology to this substation in a dictionary with keys:

                - "topo_vect": the representation of which object is connected where
                - "nb_bus": number of active buses in this substations

        Test the equality of two observations.

        2 actions are said to be identical if the have the same impact on the powergrid. This is unlrelated to their
        respective class. For example, if an BaseAction is of class :class:`BaseAction` and doesn't act on the
        _injection, it
        can be equal to a an BaseAction of derived class :class:`TopologyAction` (if the topological modification
        are the same of course).

        This implies that the attributes :attr:`BaseAction.authorized_keys` is not checked in this method.

        Note that if 2 actions doesn't act on the same powergrid, or on the same backend (eg number of loads, or
        generators is not the same in *self* and *other*, or they are not in the same order) then action will be
        declared as different.

        **Known issue** if two backend are different, but the description of the _grid are identical (ie all
        n_gen, n_load, n_line, sub_info, dim_topo, all vectors \\*_to_subid, and \\*_pos_topo_vect are
        identical) then this method will not detect the backend are different, and the action could be declared
        as identical. For now, this is only a theoretical behaviour: if everything is the same, then probably, up to
        the naming convention, then the powergrid are identical too.

        Parameters
        ----------
        other: :class:`BaseObservation`
            An instance of class BaseAction to which "self" will be compared.

        It is also possible to give fake information about the topology, the line status etc.

        In the Grid2Op framework it's also through the observation that the agent has access to some forecast (the way
        forecast are handled depends are implemented in this class). For example, forecast data (retrieved thanks to
        `chronics_handler`) are processed, but can be processed differently. One can apply load / production forecast to
        each _grid state, or to make forecast for one "reference" _grid state valid a whole day and update this one
        only etc.
        All these different mechanisms can be implemented in Grid2Op framework by overloading the `update` observation
        method.

        This class is really what a dispatcher observes from it environment.
        It can also include some temperatures, nebulosity, wind etc. can also be included in this class.

        Notes
        -----
        We strongly recommend to call :attr:`BaseObservation.reset` when implementing this function.

        two objects are connected, then we get (same example continues)

            Also, note that when "done=True" this matrix has size (1, 1)
            and contains only 0.
            
        Notes
        ------
        When the observation is in a "done" state (*eg* there has been a game over) then this function returns a 
        "matrix" of dimension (1,1) [yes, yes it's a scalar] with only one element that is 0.
        
        In this case, `load_bus`, `prod_bus`, `stor_bus`, `lor_bus` and `lex_bus` are vectors full of 0.
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        active_flow: ``bool``
            Whether to get the active flow (in MW) or the reactive flow (in MVAr). Defaults to active flow.

        as_csr_matrix: ``bool``
            Whether to retrieve the results as a scipy csr sparse matrix or as a dense matrix (default)

        Returns
        -------
        res: ``matrix``
            Which can either be a sparse matrix or a dense matrix depending on the value of the argument
            "as_csr_matrix".

        mappings: ``tuple``
            The mapping that makes the correspondence between each object and the bus to which it is connected.
            It is made of 4 elements: (load_bus, prod_bus, stor_bus, lor_bus, lex_bus).

            For example if `load_bus[i] = 14` it means that the load with id `i` is connected to the
            bus 14. If `load_bus[i] = -1` then the object is disconnected.

        Examples
        --------

        Here is how you can use this function:

        .. code-block:: python

            flow_mat, (load, prod, stor, ind_lor, ind_lex) = obs.flow_bus_matrix()

            # flow_mat is the matrix described above.

        Lots of information can be deduce from this matrix. For example if you want to know
        how much power goes from one bus say bus `i` to another bus (say bus `j` )
        you can look at the associated coefficient `flow_mat[i,j]` which will also be related to the
        flow on the origin (or extremity) side of the powerline connecting bus `i` to bus `j`

        You can also know how much power
        (total generation + total storage discharging - total load - total storage charging)
        is injected at each bus `i`
        by looking at the `i` th diagonal coefficient.

        Another use would be to check if the current powergrid state (as seen by grid2op) meet
        the Kirchhoff circuit laws (conservation of energy), by doing the sum (row by row) of this
        matrix. `flow_mat.sum(axis=1)`

        Notes
        ------
        The resulting graph is "frozen" this means that you cannot add / remove attribute on nodes or edges, nor add /
        remove edges or nodes.

        This graphs has the following properties:

        - it counts as many nodes as the number of buses of the grid (so it has a dynamic size !)
        - it counts less edges than the number of lines of the grid (two lines connecting the same buses are "merged"
          into one single edge - this is the case for parallel line, that are hence "merged" into the same edge)
        - nodes (represents "buses" of the grid) have attributes:

            - `p`: the active power produced at this node (negative means the sum of power produce minus power absorbed
              is negative) in MW
            - `q`: the reactive power produced at this node in MVAr
            - `v`: the voltage magnitude at this node
            - `cooldown`: how much longer you need to wait before being able to merge / split or change this node
            - 'sub_id': the id of the substation to which it is connected (typically between `0` and `obs.n_sub - 1`)
            - 'local_bus_id': the local bus id (from 1 to `obs.n_busbar_per_sub`) of the bus represented by this node
              (new in version 1.10.0)
            - 'global_bus_id': the global bus id (from 0 to `obs.n_busbar_per_sub * obs.n_sub - 1`) 
              of the bus represented by this node
              (new in version 1.10.0)
            - `cooldown` : the time you need to wait (in number of steps) before being able to act on the
              substation to which this bus is connected.
            - (optional) `theta`: the voltage angle (in degree) at this nodes
            
        - edges have attributes too (in this modeling an edge might represent more than one powerline, all
          parallel powerlines are represented by the same edge):

            - `nb_connected`: number of connected powerline represented by this edge.
            - `rho`: the relative flow on this powerline (in %) (sum over all powerlines))
            - `cooldown`: the number of step you need to wait before being able to act on this powerline (max over all powerlines)
            - `thermal_limit`: maximum flow allowed on the the powerline (sum over all powerlines)
            - `timestep_overflow`: number of time steps during which the powerline is on overflow (max over all powerlines)
            - `p_or`: active power injected at this node at the "origin side" (in MW) (sum over all the powerlines).
            - `p_ex`: active power injected at this node at the "extremity side" (in MW) (sum over all the powerlines).
            - `q_or`: reactive power injected at this node at the "origin side" (in MVAr) (sum over all the powerlines).
            - `q_ex`: reactive power injected at this node at the "extremity side" (in MVAr) (sum over all the powerlines).
            - `a_or`: current flow injected at this node at the "origin side" (in A) (sum over all the powerlines) (sum over all powerlines).
            - `a_ex`: current flow injected at this node at the "extremity side" (in A) (sum over all the powerlines) (sum over all powerlines).
            - `p`: active power injected at the "or" side (equal to p_or) (in MW)
            - `v_or`: voltage magnitude at the "or" bus (in kV)
            - `v_ex`: voltage magnitude at the "ex" bus (in kV)
            - `time_next_maintenance`: see :attr:`BaseObservation.time_next_maintenance` (min over all powerline)
            - `duration_next_maintenance` see :attr:`BaseObservation.duration_next_maintenance` (max over all powerlines)

            - `node_id_or`: id of the node (in this graph) of the "or" side of the powergraph
            - `node_id_ex`: id of the node (in this graph) of the "ex" side of the powergraph
            - `bus_or`: on which bus [1 or 2 or 3, etc.] is this powerline connected to at its "or" substation
              (this is the local id of the bus)
            - `bus_ex`: on which bus [1 or 2 or 3, etc.] is this powerline connected to at its "ex" substation
              (this is the local id of the bus)
            - 'global_bus_or': the global bus id (from 0 to `obs.n_busbar_per_sub * obs.n_sub - 1`) 
              of the bus to which the origin side of the line(s) represented by this edge

        .. danger::
            **IMPORTANT NOTE** edges represents "fusion" of 1 or more powerlines. This graph is intended to be
            a Graph and not a MultiGraph on purpose. This is why sometimes some attributes of the edges are not 
            the same of the attributes of a given powerlines. For example, in the case of 2 parrallel powerlines
            (say powerlines 3 and 4)
            going from bus 10 to bus 12 (for example), the edges graph.edges[(10, 12)]["nb_connected"] will be `2`
            and you will get `graph.edges[(10, 12)]["p_or"] = obs.p_or[3] + obs.p_or[4]`

        .. warning::
            The graph returned by this function has not a fixed size. Its
            number of nodes and edges can change depending on the state of the grid.
            See :ref:`get-the-graph-gridgraph` for more information.
            
            Also, note that when "done=True" this graph has only one node and
            no edge.
            
        .. note::
            The graph returned by this function is "frozen" to prevent its modification. If you really want to modify
            it you can "unfroze" it.

            This object is extensively described in the documentation, 
            see :ref:`elmnt-graph-gg` for more information.
        
        Basically, each "element" of the grid (element = a substation, a bus, a load, a generator, 
        a powerline, a storate unit or a shunt) is represented by a node in this graph.
        
        There might be some edges between the nodes representing buses and the nodes representing 
        substations, indicating "this bus is part of this substation".
        
        There might be some edges between the nodes representing load / generator / powerline / 
        storage unit / shunt and the nodes representing buses, indicating "this load / generator /
        powerline / storage unit is connected to this bus".
        
        Nodes and edges of this graph have different attributes depending on the underlying element
        they represent. For a detailed description, please refer to the documentation: 
        :ref:`elmnt-graph-gg`

        This method is used to simulate the effect of an action on a forecast powergrid state. This forecast
        state is built upon the current observation.

        The forecast are pre computed by the environment.

        More concretely, if not deactivated by the environment
        (see :func:`grid2op.Environment.BaseEnv.deactivate_forecast`) and the environment has the capacity to
        generate these forecasts (which is the case in most grid2op environments) this function will simulate
        the effect of doing an action now and return the "next state" (often the state you would get at
        time `t + 5` mins) if you were to do the action at this step.

        It has the same return
        value as the :func:`grid2op.Environment.BaseEnv.step` function.
        
        .. seealso::
            :func:`BaseObservation.get_forecast_env` and :func:`BaseObservation.get_env_from_external_forecasts`
        
        .. seealso::
            :ref:`model_based_rl`
            
        .. versionadded:: 1.9.0
            If the data of the :class:`grid2op.Environment.Environment` you are using supports it
            (**ie** you can access multiple steps ahead forecasts), then you can
            now "chain" the simulate calls.
            
        .. danger::
            A simulation can be different from the reality, even in case of perfect forecast or if
            you "simulate" an action on the current step (time_step=0).
            
            For example, the solver used can be different for "simulate" and for the environment
            "step" or you can be a setting with noisy action.
            
            A more subtle difference includes the "initialization" of the solver which is different 
            in env.step and in obs.simulate so the outcomes of the solver might be different 
            (this is especially relevant for larger grid).
            
            Even more subtle is the behaviour of the ramps for some generators. 
            
            More concretely,
            say you want to dispatch upward a generator (with a ramp of +5) of +5MW at a given 
            step. But in the same time this generator would see its production increased by +2MW
            "naturally" in the time series. Then, grid2op would limit the increase of +5MW (instead
            of +7 = +5 +2) by limiting the redispatching action to +3MW. 
            
            If you simulate the same action on the resulting step, as there are no "previous step"
            then your action will not be limited and the +5MW of redispatching will be given.
            
            You have the same phenomenon for storage losses: they are applied even if you simulate
            at the current step and conversely are not applied "multiple times" if you simulate
            for an horizon longer than 1 (say time_step=2) or if you chain two or more
            calls to "simulate".
            
        Examples
        ---------
        
        If forecast are available, you can use this function like this:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            import grid2op
            
            env_name = "l2rpn_case14_sandbox"
            env = grid2op.make(env_name)
            
            obs = env.reset()
            
            an_action = env.action_space()  # or any other action
            simobs, sim_reward, sim_done, sim_info = obs.simulate(an_action)
        
            # in this case, simobs will be an APPROXIMATION of the observation you will
            # get after performing `an_action`
            # obs, *_ = env.step(an_action)
            
        And if your environment allows to use "multiple steps ahead forecast" you can even
        chain the calls like this:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            import grid2op
            
            env_name = "l2rpn_case14_sandbox"
            env = grid2op.make(env_name)
            
            obs = env.reset()
            
            an_action = env.action_space()  # or any other action
            simobs1, sim_reward1, sim_done1, sim_info1 = obs.simulate(an_action)   
            
            another_action = env.action_space()  # or any other action
            simobs2, sim_reward2, sim_done2, sim_info2 = simobs1.simulate(another_action)     
            
            # in this case, simobs will be an APPROXIMATION of the observation you will
            # get after performing `an_action` and then `another_action`:
            # *_ = env.step(an_action)
            # obs, *_ = env.step(another_action) 
        

        Parameters
        ----------
        action: :class:`grid2op.Action.BaseAction`
            The action to simulate

        time_step: ``int``
            The time step of the forecasted grid to perform the action on. If no forecast are available for this
            time step, a :class:`grid2op.Exceptions.NoForecastAvailable` is thrown.

        Raises
        ------
        :class:`grid2op.Exceptions.NoForecastAvailable`
            if no forecast are available for the time_step querried.

        Returns
        -------
        simulated_observation: :class:`grid2op.Observation.BaseObservation`
            agent's observation of the current environment after the application of the action "act" on the
            the current state.

        reward: ``float``
            amount of reward returned after previous action

        done: ``bool``
            whether the episode has ended, in which case further step() calls will return undefined results

        info: ``dict``
            contains auxiliary diagnostic information (helpful for debugging, and sometimes learning)

        Notes
        ------
        This is a simulation in the sense that the "next grid state" is not the real grid state you will get. As you
        don't know the future, the "injections you forecast for the next step" will not be the real injection you
        will get in the next step.

        Also, in some circumstances, the "Backend" (ie the powerflow) used to do the simulation may not be the
        same one as the one used by the environment. This is to model a real fact: as accurate your powerflow is,
        it does
        not model all the reality (*"all models are wrong"*). Having a different solver for the environment (
        "the reality") than the one used to anticipate the impact of the action (this "simulate" function)
        is a way to represent this fact.

        Examples
        --------
        To simulate what would be the effect of the action "act" if you were to take this action at this step
        you can do the following:

        .. code-block:: python

            import grid2op
            # retrieve an environment
            env_name = "l2rpn_case14_sandbox"  # or any other name
            env = grid2op.make(env_name)

            # retrieve an observation, this is the same for all observations
            obs = env.reset()

            # and now you can simulate the effect of doing nothing in the next time step
            act = env.action_space()  # this can be any action that grid2op understands
            simulated_obs, simulated_reward, simulated_done, simulated_info = obs.simulate(act)

            # `simulated_obs` will be the "observation" after the application of action `act` on the
            #                 " forecast of the grid state (it will be the "forecast state at time t+5mins usually)
            # `simulated_reward` will be the reward for the same action on the same forecast state
            # `simulated_done` will indicate whether or not the simulation ended up in a "game over"
            # `simulated_info` gives extra information on this forecast state


        You can now chain the calls to simulate (if your environment supports it)
        
        .. code-block:: python

            import grid2op
            env_name = "l2rpn_case14_sandbox"  # or any other name
            env = grid2op.make(env_name)
            obs = env.reset()
            
            act_1 = ...  # a grid2op action
            # you can do that (if your environment provide forecasts more tha 1 step ahead):
            sim_obs_1, *_ = obs.simulate(act_1)
            
            act_2 = ...  # a grid2op action
            # but also (if your environment provide forecast more than 2 steps ahead)
            sim_obs_2, *_ = sim_obs_1.simulate(act_2)
            
            act_3 = ... # a grid2op action
            # but also (if your environment provide forecast more than 3 steps ahead)
            sim_obs_3, *_ = sim_obs_2.simulate(act_3)
            
            # you get the idea!
            
        .. note::
            The code above is closely related to the :func:`BaseObservation.get_forecast_env` and a 
            very similar result (up to some corner cases beyond the scope of this documentation)
            could be achieved with:
            
            .. code-block:: python

                import grid2op
                env_name = "l2rpn_case14_sandbox"  # or any other name
                env = grid2op.make(env_name)
                obs = env.reset()
                
                forecast_env = obs.get_forecast_env()
                f_obs = forecast_env.reset()
                
                act_1 = ...  # a grid2op action
                f_obs_1, *_ = forecast_env.step(act_1)
                # f_obs_1 should be sim_obs_1
                
                act_2 = ...  # a grid2op action
                f_obs_2, *_ = forecast_env.step(act_2)
                # f_obs_2 should be sim_obs_2
                
                act_3 = ... # a grid2op action
                f_obs_3, *_ = forecast_env.step(act_3)
                # f_obs_3 should be sim_obs_3
            
        Finally, another possible use of this method is to get a "glimpse" of the 
        effect of an action if you delay it a maximum, you can also use the `time_step`

        Easier access to the impact on the observation if an action were applied.

        This is for now only useful to get a topology in which the grid would be without
        doing an expensive `obs.simuulate`

        Notes
        -----
        This will not give the real topology of the grid in all cases for many reasons amongst:

        1) past topologies are not known by the observation. If you reconnect a powerline in the action
           without having specified on which bus, it has no way to know (but the environment does!)
           on which bus it should be reconnected (which is the last known bus)
        2) some "protections" are emulated in the environment. This means that the environment
           can disconnect some powerline under certain conditions. This is absolutely not
           taken into account here.
        3) the environment is stochastic, for example there can be maintenance or attacks (hazards)
           and the generators and loads change each step. This is not taken into account
           in this function.
        4) no checks are performed to see if the action meets the rules of the game (number of elements
           you can modify in the action, cooldowns etc.) This method **supposes** that the action
           is legal and non ambiguous.
        5) It do not check for possible "game over", for example due to isolated elements or non-connected
           grid (grid with 2 or more connex components)

        If these issues are important for you, you will need to use the
        :func:`grid2op.Observation.BaseObservation.simulate` method. It can be used like
        `obs.simulate(act, time_step=0)` but it is much more expensive.

        Parameters
        ----------
        act: :class:`grid2op.Action.BaseAction`
            The action you want to add to the observation

        issue_warn: ``bool``
            Issue a warning when this method might not compute the proper resulting topologies. Default to ``True``:
            it issues warning when something not supported is done in the action.

        Returns
        -------
        res: :class:`grid2op.Observation.BaseObservation`
            The resulting observation. Note that this observation is not initialized with everything.
            It is only relevant when you want to study the resulting topology after you applied an
            action. Lots of `res` attributes are empty.

        Examples
        --------
        You can use it this way, for example if you want to retrieve the topology you would get (see the restriction
        in the above description) after applying an action:

        .. code-block:: python

            import grid2op

            # create the environment
            env_name = "l2rpn_case14_sandbox"  # or any other name
            env = grid2op.make(env_name)

            # generate the first observation
            obs = env.reset()

            # make some action
            act = ...  # see the dedicated page

            # have a look at the impact on the action on the topology
            partial_obs = obs + act
            # or `partial_obs = obs.add_act(act, issue_warn=False)` if you want to silence the warnings

            # and now you can inspect the topology with any method you want:
            partial_obs.topo_vect
            partial_obs.load_bus
            bus_mat = partial_obs.bus_connectivity_matrix()
            # or even
            elem_mat = partial_obs.connectivity_matrix()

            # but you cannot use
            partial_obs.prod_p
            # or
            partial_obs.load_q

        This function will return a grid2op "environment" where the data (load, generation and maintenance)
        comes from the provided forecast data.
        
        This "forecasted environment" can be used like any grid2op environment. It checks the same "rules" as the 
        :func:`BaseObservation.simulate` (if you want to change them, make sure to use
        :func:`grid2op.Environment.BaseEnv.change_forecast_parameters` or 
        :func:`BaseObservation.change_forecast_parameters`), with the exact same behaviour 
        as "env.step(...)".
        
        This can be particularly useful for model based RL for example. 

        Data should be:
        
        - `load_p` a numpy array of float32 (or convertible to it) with n_rows and n_load columns
          representing the load active values in MW.
        - `load_q` a numpy array of float32 (or convertible to it) with n_rows and n_load columns
          representing the load reactive values in MVAr.
        - `gen_p` a numpy array of float32 (or convertible to it) with n_rows and n_gen columns
          representing the generation active values in MW.
        - `gen_v` a numpy array of float32 (or convertible to it) with n_rows and n_gen columns
          representing the voltage magnitude setpoint in kV.
        
        All arrays are optional. If nothing is provided for a given array then it's replaced by the value 
        in the observation. For example, if you do not provided the `gen_p` value then `obs.gen_p` is used.
        
        All provided arrays should have the same number of rows.
        
        .. note::
            Maintenance will be added from the information of the observation. If you don't want to add
            maintenance, you can passe the kwarg `with_maintenance=False`
            
        .. seealso::
            :func:`BaseObservation.simulate` and :func:`BaseObservation.get_forecast_env`
        
        .. seealso::
            :ref:`model_based_rl`
        
        .. note::
            With this method, you can have as many "steps" in the forecasted environment as you want. You are
            not limited with the amount of data provided: if you send data with 10 rows, you have 10 steps. If 
            you have 100 rows then you have 100 steps. 
        
        .. warning::
            We remind that, if you provide some forecasts, it is expected that they allow some powerflow to converge.
            The balance between total generation on one side and total demand and losses on the other should also
            make "as close as possible" to reduce some modeling artifact (by the backend, grid2op does not check
            anything here).
            
            Finally, make sure that your input data meet the constraints on the generators (pmin, pmax and ramps)
            otherwise you might end up with incorrect behaviour. Grid2op supposes that data fed to it
            is consistent with its model. If not it's "undefined behaviour".
        
        .. danger::
    
            Long story short, once a environment (and a forecast_env is one) 
            is deleted, you cannot use anything it "holds" including,
            but not limited to the capacity to perform `obs.simulate(...)` even if the `obs` is still
            referenced.
