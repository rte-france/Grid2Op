Change Log
=============
[0.6.0] - 2020-xx-yy
--------------------
TODO for next versions

- [???] include grid2Viz in a notebook (the notebook "StudyYourAgent")
- [???] add the "anti-agent"
- [???] rationalize the public and private part of the API. Some members now are public but should be private.
- [???] rationalize the names of plotting utilities
- [???] implement other "rewards" to look at (have a reward for training, but the possibility to inspect other loss)
- [???] do something to help grid2viz to parse back action.
- [???] better explanation of the notebook 3 with action silently
- [???] have something remembering the topology in the environment, and when an object is
  reconnected, and no buses are specified, then it connects it to last buses.
- [???] simulate in MultiEnv
- [???] in MultiEnv, when some converter of the observations are used, have each child process to compute
   it in parrallel and transfer the resulting data.
- [???] fast implementation of "replay" using PlotPygame and EpisodeData
- [???] fix notebook 3 to include code of new agents, and especially to work consistently with runner and env
  (for now if you change default env, it doesn't affect the runner, so it crashes)
- [???] modeled batteries / pumped storage in grid2op (generator but that can be charged / discharged)
- [???] modeled dumps in grid2op (stuff that have a given energy max, and cannot produce more than the available energy)

- [ADDED] runner now is able to show a progress bar
- [ADDED] add a "max_iter" in the runner.

  possibility to simulate redispatching actions as well.
- [UPDATED] Notebook 6 to train agent more efficiently (example: prediction of actions in batch)
- [UPDATED] PlotGraph to derive from `GridObjects` allowing to be inialized at creation and not when first
  observation is loaded (usable without observation)
- [UPDATED] new default environment (`case14_relistic`)
- [UPDATED] data for the new created environment.
- [UPDATED] implement redispatching action in `obs.simulate`

- [UPDATED] more information in the error when plotly and seaborn are not installed and trying to load the
  graph of the grid.
- [UPDATED] setting an object to a busbar higher (or equal) than 2 now leads to an ambiguous action.
- [UPDATED] gitignore to really download the "prod_charac.csv" file
- [UPDATED] private member in action space and observation space (`_template_act` and `_empty_obs`)
  to make it clear it's not part of the public API.

[0.5.4] - 2020-02-06
---------------------
- [ADDED] better handling of serialization of scenarios.

- [FIXED] Some typos on the notebook "getting_started\4-StudyYourAgent.ipynb".
- [FIXED] Error in the conversion of observation to dictionnary. Twice the same keys were used
  ('time_next_maintenance') for both `time_next_maintenance` and `duration_next_maintenance`.
- [UPDATED] The first chronics that is processed by a runner is not the "first" one on the hardrive
  (if sorted in alphabetical order)

[0.5.1] - 2020-01-24
--------------------
- [ADDED] extra tag 'all' to install all optional dependencies.
- [FIXED] issue in the documentation of Observation, voltages are given in kV and not V.
- [FIXED] a bug in the runner that prevented the right chronics to be read, and output wrong names
- [FIXED] a bug preventing import if plotting packages where not installed, that causes the documentation to crash.

[0.5.0] - 2020-01-23
--------------------
- [BREAKING] Action/Backend has been modified with the implementation of redispatching. If
  you used a custom backend, you'll have to implement the "redispatching" part.
- [BREAKING] with the introduction of redispatching, old action space and observation space,
  stored as json for example, will not be usable: action size and observation size
  have been modified.
- [ADDED] A converter class that allows to pre-process observation, and post-process action
  when given to an `Agent`. This allows for more flexibility in the `action_space` and
  `observation_space`.
- [ADDED] Adding another example notebook `getting_started/Example_5bus.ipynb`
- [ADDED] Adding another renderer for the live environment.
- [ADDED] Redispatching possibility for the environment
- [ADDED] More complete documentation of the representation of the powergrid
  (see documentation of `Space`)
- [FIXED] A bug in the conversion from pair unit to kv in pandapower backend. Adding some tests for that too.
- [UPDATED] More complete documentation of the Action class (with some examples)
- [UPDATED] More unit test for observations
- [UPDATED] Remove the TODO's already coded
- [UPDATED] GridStateFromFile can now read the starting date and the time interval of the chronics.
- [UPDATED] Documentation of Observation: adding the units
  (`issue 22 <https://github.com/rte-france/Grid2Op/issues/22>`_)
- [UPDATED] Notebook `getting_started/4_StudyYourAgent.ipynb` to use the converter now (much shorter and clearer)

[0.4.3] - 2020-01-20
--------------------
- [FIXED] Bug in L2RPN2019 settings, that had not been modified after the changes of version 0.4.2.

[0.4.2] - 2020-01-08
--------------------
- [BREAKING] previous saved Action Spaces and Observation Spaces (as dictionnary) are no more compatible
- [BREAKING] renaming of attributes describing the powergrid across classes for better consistency:
