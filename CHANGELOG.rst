===========

[0.6.0] - 2020-xx-yy
--------------------
TODO for next versions

- [???] test and doc for opponent
- [???] better logging
- [???] rationalize the public and private part of the API. Some members now are public but should be private.
- [???] rationalize the names of plotting utilities
- [???] better explanation of the notebook 3 with action silently
- [???] have something remembering the topology in the environment, and when an object is
  reconnected, and no buses are specified, then it connects it to last buses.
- [???] see if "simulate" performances can be improved, and performances in general.
- [???] simulate in MultiEnv
- [???] in MultiEnv, when some converter of the observations are used, have each child process to compute
  it in parrallel and transfer the resulting data.
- [???] fast implementation of "replay" using PlotPygame and EpisodeData
- [???] fix notebook 3 to include code of new agents, and especially to work consistently with runner and env
  (for now if you change default env, it doesn't affect the runner, so it crashes)
- [???] modeled batteries / pumped storage in grid2op (generator but that can be charged / discharged)
- [???] modeled dumps in grid2op (stuff that have a given energy max, and cannot produce more than the available energy)
- [???] fix notebook 5 texts

[0.6.0] - 2020-04-??
---------------------
- [BREAKING] `grid2op.GameRules` module renamed to `grid2op.Rules`
- [BREAKING] `grid2op.Converters` module renamed `grid2op.Converter`
- [BREAKING] `grid2op.ChronicsHandler` renamed to `grid2op.Chronics`
- [BREAKING] `grid2op.PandaPowerBackend` is moved to `grid2op.Backend.PandaPowerBackend`
- [BREAKING] `GameRules.Allwayslegal` is now `Rules.Alwayslegal`
- [BREAKING] Plotting utils are now located in their own module `grid2op.Plot`
- [DEPRECATION] `HelperAction` is now called `ActionSpace` to better suit open ai gym name. Use of `HelperAction`
  will be deprecated in future versions.
- [DEPRECATION] `ObservationHelper` is now called `ObservationSpace` to better suit open ai gym name.
  Use of `ObservationHelper` will be deprecated in future versions.
- [ADDED] different kind of "Opponent" can now be implemented if needed (missing deep testing, different type of
  class, and good documentation)
- [ADDED] implement other "rewards" to look at. It is now possible to have an environment that will compute more rewards
  that are given to the agent through the "information" return argument of `env.step`. See the documentation of
  Environment.other_rewards.
- [ADDED] Alternative method to load datasets based on new dataset format: MakeEnv.make2
- [FIXED] Loading L2RPN_2019 dataset
- [FIXED] a bug that prevents the voltage controler to be changed when using `grid2op.make`.
- [FIXED] `time_before_cooldown_line` vector where output twice in observation space
  (see `issue 47 <https://github.com/rte-france/Grid2Op/issues/47>`_ part 1)
- [FIXED] the number of active bus on a substation was not computed properly, which lead to some unexpected
  behavior regarding the powerlines switches (depending on current stats of powerline, changing the buses of some
  powerline has different effect)
  (see `issue 47 <https://github.com/rte-france/Grid2Op/issues/47>`_ part 2)
- [FIXED] wrong voltages were reported for PandapowerBackend that causes some isolated load to be not detected
  (see `issue 51 <https://github.com/rte-france/Grid2Op/issues/51>`_ )
- [FIXED] improve the install script to not crash when numba can be installed, but cannot be loaded.
  (see `issue 50 <https://github.com/rte-france/Grid2Op/issues/50>`_ )
- [UPDATED] import documentation of `Space` especially in case someone wants to build other type of Backend

- [ADDED] when a file is not present in the chronics, the chronics_handler behaves as if
  nothing changes. If no files at all are provided, it raises an error.

  (See `VoltageControler` for more information). It can be customized as of now.
- [ADDED] lots of new tests for majority of classes (ChronicsHandler, Action, Observations etc.)

  pandapower backend.
- [FIXED] `ReadPypowNetData` does not crash when argument "chunk_size" is provided now.
- [FIXED] some typos in the Readme
- [FIXED] some redispatching declared illegal but are in fact legal (due to
  a wrong assessment) (see `issue 44 <https://github.com/rte-france/Grid2Op/issues/44>`_)
- [FIXED] reconnecting a powerline now does not count the mandatory actions on both its ends (previously you could not
  reconnect a powerline with the L2RPN 2019 rules because it required acting on 2 substations) as "substation action"
- [UPDATED] add a blank environment for easier use.
- [UPDATED] now raise an error if the substations layout does not match the number of substations on the powergrid.
- [UPDATED] better handling of system without numba `issue 42 <https://github.com/rte-france/Grid2Op/issues/42>`_)

  possibility to simulate redispatching actions as well.
- [UPDATED] Notebook 6 to train agent more efficiently (example: prediction of actions in batch)
- [UPDATED] PlotGraph to derive from `GridObjects` allowing to be inialized at creation and not when first
  observation is loaded (usable without observation)
- [UPDATED] new default environment (`case14_relistic`)
- [UPDATED] data for the new created environment.
- [UPDATED] implement redispatching action in `obs.simulate`

  graph of the grid.
- [UPDATED] setting an object to a busbar higher (or equal) than 2 now leads to an ambiguous action.
- [UPDATED] gitignore to really download the "prod_charac.csv" file
- [UPDATED] private member in action space and observation space (`_template_act` and `_empty_obs`)
  to make it clear it's not part of the public API.
- [UPDATED] change default environment to `case14_redisp`
- [UPDATED] notebook 2 now explicitely says the proposed action is ambiguous in a python cell code (and not just
  in the comments) see issue (`issue 27 <https://github.com/rte-france/Grid2Op/issues/27>`_)

[0.5.4] - 2020-02-06
---------------------

- [FIXED] Some typos on the notebook "getting_started\4-StudyYourAgent.ipynb".
- [FIXED] Error in the conversion of observation to dictionnary. Twice the same keys were used
  ('time_next_maintenance') for both `time_next_maintenance` and `duration_next_maintenance`.
- [UPDATED] The first chronics that is processed by a runner is not the "first" one on the hardrive
  (if sorted in alphabetical order)

--------------------
- [ADDED] extra tag 'all' to install all optional dependencies.

[0.5.0] - 2020-01-23
--------------------
- [BREAKING] Action/Backend has been modified with the implementation of redispatching. If
  you used a custom backend, you'll have to implement the "redispatching" part.
- [BREAKING] with the introduction of redispatching, old action space and observation space,
  stored as json for example, will not be usable: action size and observation size
  have been modified.
- [ADDED] A converter class that allows to pre-process observation, and post-process action
  when given to an `Agent`. This allows for more flexibility in the `action_space` and
  `observation_space`.
- [ADDED] Adding another example notebook `getting_started/Example_5bus.ipynb`
- [ADDED] Adding another renderer for the live environment.
- [ADDED] Redispatching possibility for the environment
- [ADDED] More complete documentation of the representation of the powergrid
  (see documentation of `Space`)

- [UPDATED] More complete documentation of the Action class (with some examples)
- [UPDATED] More unit test for observations
- [UPDATED] Remove the TODO's already coded
- [UPDATED] GridStateFromFile can now read the starting date and the time interval of the chronics.
- [UPDATED] Documentation of Observation: adding the units
  (`issue 22 <https://github.com/rte-france/Grid2Op/issues/22>`_)
- [UPDATED] Notebook `getting_started/4_StudyYourAgent.ipynb` to use the converter now (much shorter and clearer)

[0.4.3] - 2020-01-20
--------------------
- [FIXED] Bug in L2RPN2019 settings, that had not been modified after the changes of version 0.4.2.

[0.4.2] - 2020-01-08
--------------------
- [BREAKING] previous saved Action Spaces and Observation Spaces (as dictionnary) are no more compatible
