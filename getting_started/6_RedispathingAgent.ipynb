    "In the L2RPN 2019 challenges, we rewarded participants based on the use of the powerlines. In next challenges, or for other uses of this platform where redispatching should be considered, it's better to consider the economic cost of the sytem as an evaluation metric. However, usually a cost should be minimized, while a reward should be maximized. To take this into account, a simple reward named \"EconomicReward\" has been created. It has the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- it returns -1 if there has been a game over\n",

    "Compared to standard \"economic dispatch\" problems, for now storages are not implemented (coming soon) and we don't fully take into account the startup cost, shutdown cost, as well as minimum downtime and minimum uptime (even though all of these features are implemented). Also, note that redispatching is implemented in differences, meaning that you first need to provide an economic dispatch, and then think in terms of variations from that point onward. This is the usage that will be explained in this notebook. For real unit commitment / economic dispatch problems, the key words \"injections\" / \"prod_p\" for the action would probably be more suited."

    "Unlike topological actions, that are always feasible (this is an assumption that is made in this package), redispatching actions are limited by physical constraints on the generators. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- it is not possible for a generator to produce more (resp. less) than pmax (resp. pmin). Unlike the curent flow on the powerline, this is a strict physical constraint.\n",
    "- it is not possible, for the same physical limitations, to increase (or decrease) too much the value between two consecutive time steps.\n",
    "- redispatching actions stack with one another. It means that if you ask to increase the production of the generator 1 by $10MW$ at time step t, and by $20MW$ at time step $t+1$, it means that the set point at time step $t+1$ will be $+30MW$ higher than if no redispatching had been made (it would have been only $+10MW$ higher if the second redispatching action had not been performed).\n",
    "\n",
    "That being said, a lot of thing can happen, that make redispatching a bit less trivial than topology:\n",
    "- When you do a redispatching action, you don't know what the time series of the environment look like. For example, say the pmax of generator 1 is 100. The setpoint of this generator at time t is $60MW$, and you want to increase its value by another $40MW$. This action is legal: $60+40 \\leq pmax (=100) $. So at time $t$ everything is fine. Now let's suppose that the environment also moved the setpoint of this same generator from $60$ to be at $70MW$ at time $t+1$. With the redispatching action, this would mean that the setpoint would be $70+40 = 110 > pmax$. This is not possible. In this case, the redispatching action will be capped : instead of the desired redispatching of $+40$, only a smaller redispatching of $+30$ will be implemented on the powergrid. \n",
    "- Another problem can arise with the fundamental principle of power grid: power energy cannot be stored in a grid. At each time we then have $\\sum \\text{Prod} = \\sum \\text{Load} + \\text{Losses}$. In this competition, the data is generated such that this condition holds (approximately) for all time steps. This means that if you ask for a redispatching of +xxx MW on a given generator, then the other ones must compensate and \"absorb\" xxx MW such that it sums to 0 overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Out of simplicity for the participants, there are some \"automatons\" that automatically transform an proposed redispatching action into a valid redispatching action. These automatons basically ensure that the two above-mentionned conditions hold. It explains the differences between \"target_redispatching\" which is the desired setpoint enter by the agent, and the \"actual_redispatching\" which is the one that has actually been implemented on the powergrid after it has been corrected by the automatons."
