    "## The reality <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"reality\"></a>\n",
    "A powergrid is a really complex man made \"object\". In our case, a powergrid can be represented as a set of \"objects\" that are:\n",
    "- powerlines (with two ends : \"origin\" and \"extremity\")\n",
    "- loads (usually the size of a small city or of a big industrial firm)\n",
    "- generators (usually big power plants, such as wind farm, dumps, coal or nuclear powerplants for example)\n",
    "\n",
    "All these objects are connected together in some places called \"substations\". In reality a substation looks like this:\n",
    "![](./img/Taipei_Taiwan_Electrical_Substation.jpg)\n",
    "(image credit https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Taipei_Taiwan_Electrical-Substation-at-Taipei-Zoo-South-Station-01.jpg )\n",
    "\n",
    "Substations are connected together with \"powerlines\" that allow some power to flow from one place to another:\n",
    "![](./img/Powerline_separators.jpg)\n",
    "(image credit https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Powerline-separators.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "## The fiction (aka our \"model\") <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"fiction\"></a>\n",
    "Of course, in the grid2Op framework, we will not detail every object you can see on these pictures. For us, a powergrid (here relatively simple) will be represented as:\n",
    "![](./img/powergrid.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above figure you can see  :\n",
    "- Substations represented as circles, you can see five on this figure, labelled 0, 1, ..., 4\n",
    "- Powerlines showed with... lines on this plot, you can see eight powerlines there\n",
    "- Generators displayed with small green circle, there are two\n",
    "- Loads displayed with small orange cirle, three on this simple powergrid.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Focus on a substation <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"substation\"></a>\n",
    "Now let's zoom (or at least pretend to) on substation with id 2:\n",
    "![](./img/powergrid_zoom2.png)\n",
    "As you can see on the right part (bottom) this substation (as all substations in grid2op) has 2 \"busbars\" (represented here as vertical black lines). Note that in all these diagrams, powerlines are represented with blue lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "What does it entails ? It entails that we can \"split\" a substation into different independant \"buses\". A \"bus\" is a fancy word from the power system community meaning that: *if two objects are on the same bus, then there exist a direct electrical path in the substation connecting them*. But wait, how can you split buses ?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## An object in a substation <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"object\"></a>\n",
    "In fact, in our modeling, for each \"object\" in a substation, we have two switches as showed in the image below:\n",
    "![](./img/powergrid_zoom3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "And we can choose to either connect the object (in this case, the powerline with id 1) to either busbars (denoted by \"a\" and \"b\" in the figure).\n",
    "\n",
    "So basically, the main goal of the grid2op platform is to be able to model in particular what is the \"best\" position of these switches. In all grid2op framework, when we speak about the ***topology*** you can imagine it being the list of the positions of each switch in the grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Different configurations <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"config\"></a>\n",
    "This possibility to change the switches configuration, lead to multiple configurations of the elements per substation. If we take the example of the substation 2 (that we already used above) we can list the number of possible configurations:\n",
    "![](./img/all_topo.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**NB**: Here we only listed the topologies with all elements connected (in grid2op it is possible to disconnect a powerline for example). We also didn't take into account the symmetries of the situation. For example, the *topology* we called \"*topo 2: {1,4}; {5,6}*\" has been here represented with object 1 and 4 connected to busbar *b* and object 5 and 6 to busbar *a* it would have been equivalent to assign 5 and 6 to busbar *b* and 1 and 4 to busbar *a*. What matters here is that objects 1 and 4 are electrically isolated from object 5 and 6 in this substation: there is not electrical path that connects 5 and 4 in this *topology*\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to be \"valid\" a topology must also ensure some physical constraints. For example:\n",
    "- we could decide to connect the 1,4 and 5 to busbar *a* and leave 6 alone on busbar *b*. This is not strictly impossible (and it is not equivalent to disconnect powerline 6). In reality it can serve certain purposes, mostly related to voltages. However, we do not recommend to use this kind of topology.\n",
    "- having a load alone on a busbar (=without having one powerline connected to the same busbar) is equivalent to disconnect it, and will lead to a *game over*.\n",
    "- having a generator alone on a busbar (=without having one powerline connected to the same busbar) is also equivalent to disconnect it, it will also lead to a game over.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Note on the topology count <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"topo_count\"></a>\n",
    "When trying to modify the topology of the powergrid, you can expect 1) highly non linear effects (that we will cover in the next notebook) and 2) a dramatic increase of the number of actions you can perform at each time step.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to emphasize this: Action spaces in power systems are really humongous. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Different possibilities  per substation\n",
    "As we covered in the previous subsection (Different configurations) the number of different configurations for a substation having *k* elements is on the order of $2^{k-1}$. For example, for the standard IEEE 118 grid used in many power system publications, one single substation counts 17 elements. This leads to $\\approx 2^{16} = 65.536$ configurations for this substation alone (*i.e* if you only care about finding the exact topology of this substations counting 17 elements, you need to choose among more than $65.000$ possible actions).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modifying all substations\n",
    "But in theory, you could change not only the topology of one single substation but on as many substations as you want (**in theory**, see section *Introduction of \"operational constraints\" in grid2op* for more information). So say the first substations counts 11 elements, and the second one 17 elements. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can choose among $\\approx 2^{11-1}$ actions for the first and among $\\approx 2^{16-1}$ actions for the second substations, this leads to $1024 \\times  65.536 \\approx 65.000.000$ actions for the two substations. There are only 116 more to consider...\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, we sum up in the table below the total number of possible topological actions for some grid you can used in grid2op:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "|grid2op env name |Number of substations | number of powerlines| total number of topologies |\n",

    "In reality though, we modeled different type of \"constraints\" that makes this total number of \"actions\" completely irrelevant. We decided, in the grid2op framework to enforce some operational constraints we decided to enforce some limitation that dramatically reduce the action space above. These limitations can be modified from the `Parameters` class\n",

    "He would not act on more than one or two substations at the same time (this part is probably more limited by the fact humans cannot focus efficiently on many things at the same time).\n",
    "\n",
    "So we decided to have 2 attributes of the `Parameters` class:\n",
    "- `MAX_LINE_STATUS_CHANGED` will limit the number of powerline status you can change in a single action (it is usually set to `1`)\n",
    "- `MAX_SUB_CHANGED` will limit the number of substation you can change at the same time (it is also usually set to 1)\n",

    "\n",
    "## Comparison with \"the reality\" <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"comp_with_real\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to emphasize that this modeling is an (over) over simplification of the reality. \n",
    "\n",
    "- In reality there can also be \"switches\" that can connect the two busbars (reconfiguring the topology of the substation can be done with only one switch, but on the other hand, sometimes changing one switch will have no effect at all).\n",

    "\n",
    "- Finally, most of the time a single busbar count a \"switch\" in its middle that allows to disconnect part of the element connected to it to another part. Basically this entails that some combinaison of elements are not possible to perform\n",
    "\n",
    "*Additional precisions about the number of independant busbsars per susbtations*: Starting from grid2op 1.10.2 you can now have any number of busbars you want per susbtations. For example, you can create an environment with:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "env = grid2op.make(\"l2rpn_case14_sandbox\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "To have the default of 2 busbars per susbtations. But you can also do:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "env_3 = grid2op.make(\"l2rpn_case14_sandbox\", n_busbar=3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then you end-up with 3 busbars for all substations or you can even do:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "env_1 = grid2op.make(\"l2rpn_case14_sandbox\", n_busbar=1)\n",

    "And of course, we model explicitly in this framework (*eg* we allow the agents to act on) only some elements of a powergrid. In reality, much more heterogeneous objects exists with more complex properties. \n",
    "\n",
    "We decided to make all these assumptions because we thought it was the easiest setting that allow to perform some topological reconfiguration, beside connecting / disconnecting powerlines.\n",
    "\n",
    "So keep in mind that the tables presented above are an overly underestimated number of actions companies in charge of the powergrid can take at the same time, mostly because the \"real\" grid can count more than $10.000$ substations, because much more objects are connected at each substations and also because some substations can often be \"split\" into a dozen independant \"buses\".
