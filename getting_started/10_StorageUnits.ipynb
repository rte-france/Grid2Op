    "## II) What are storage units ?\n",
    "\n",
    "### A) Description\n",
    "Storage units are \"elements\" of a grid that can act sometimes as generators, sometimes as load (depending on what they are told to do). Storage units can basically store a certain quantity of energy (then acting as load) and release this energy to the power system when asked (then acting as generators)\n",
    "\n",
    "The two main types of storage units we can think of are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"pumped storage\": they store electric power by pumping it in an upward reservoir and can produce it again by letting the water through a turbine when going downhill (see this [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumped-storage_hydroelectricity) for more information)\n",
    "- \"batteries\": they store energy in a chemical form and can charge/discharge similarly to the battery of a cellphone, but in (way, way) bigger.\n",
    "\n",
    "In grid2op a storage unit is defined by different parameters. The main ones are:\n",
    "- `storage_Emax`: the maximum energy (expressed in MWh) the storage unit can contain. \n",
    "- `storage_Emin`: the minimum energy (in MWh) allowed in the unit (for example some batteries should not be \"emptied\" entirely)\n",
    "- `storage_loss`: the loss (in MW) in the storage unit. This corresponds to the loss of energy that happens continuously. In reality, for example, this can model the \"self discharge\" of a battery or the evaporation of the upper lake in pumped storage. It should not be mixed with the following two attributes.\n",
    "- `storage_charging_efficiency`: this is the efficiency when the storage unit is charged. This efficiency corresponds to the amount of energy that will be stored in the unit if a power of 1MW is taken from the grid to charge it during 1 hour. It has no unit and should be between 0 and 1.\n",
    "- `storage_discharging_efficiency`: this is the efficiency when the storage unit is discharged. This efficiency corresponds to the amount of energy that will be subtracted from the unit if a power of 1MW is injected into the powergrid during 1 hour. It has no unit and should be between 0 and 1.\n",
    "- `storage_max_p_prod`: the maximum value (still seen from the grid) that a storage unit can inject into the grid. It is expressed in MW.\n",
    "- `storage_max_p_absorb`: the maximum value (still from the grid point of view) that a storage unit can absorb from the grid, expressed also in MW.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [official documentation](https://grid2op.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modeled_elements.html#storage-units-optional) gives more details about all these attributes and some others too. In the following cell, we give an example of how to access such attributes."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### B) Convention\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different conventions to model power grid elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the storage unit, we adopted the \"load convention\". In short, this means that:\n",
    "- if a positive power setpoint is given, then the storage will behave like a load. It will absorb power from the grid. It will recharge.\n",
    "- if this same power is negative, then the storage will behave like a generator. It will inject power into the grid. It will discharge.\n",
    "\n",
    "## III) Actions on storage units\n",
    "\n",
    "Like any other grid2op object, storage units are modified through actions. The only modification you can do with storage units is to give a setpoint of how much power you want the storage unit to absorb/produce. This action is done with the \"*storage_p*\" keys.\n",

Therefore, at each step, if nothing is done, the total load can be powered by the total generation without the intervention of any \"agent\" in grid2op.\n",
    "\n",
    "This fact above has some implications when using storage units.  For example, if you decide to act on the storage unit, then you will either increase the load (if you charge the units) or the generation (if you discharge them). With this action, you will affect the above balance which in response becomes inbalanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "To restore the balance between total generation, and total demand, as in the case of curtailment, dispatchable generators are used. In fact, if you ask for a storage action that does not sum to 0, then automatically, the environment will perform some dispatch on the generators. \n",
