    "**GOAL**: The goal of the \"game\" you will play is the following: given some phyiscal constraints (more on that on the next section) your agent will need to adjust the productions of the dispatchable generators as to minimize the  \"margin\" of each powerline on the grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) Definition of the reward\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The joule's effect and the sag\n",
    "In reality, each powerline cannot transmit an infinite amount of power. \n",
    "\n",
    "Due to some constraints: for example, when too much current pass on a line, because of the Joule's effect, this powerline heats. And because powerlines are made in metal, when they heat they inflate and so get closer to the ground... or... your house...\n",
    "\n",
    "This phenomenon is illustrated in the figure below:\n",
    "\n",
    "The flow is relatively small, the powerline is far above the tree\n",
    "![title](img/sag0.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The flow increases, the powerline gets closer to the tree\n",
    "![title](img/sag1.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The flow is too high, the powerline gets closer even closer to the tree and ends up touching it\n",
    "![title](img/sag2.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Which can, in the best case break the powerline or, depending on the season, the weather, etc. set aflame a whole part of a state (this is the cause of some of the fire in California in 2020) possibly killing dozens of people.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Thermal limits and protections\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid being in such trouble, companies operating powergrids, often set up some limits on the flows that can be transmitted on the powergrid. For the sake of the example, we displayed the this limit (called thermal limit) on each powerline on the grid in the next cell."

    "And to be certains that the flows stays below these limits, every powerlines (on our simplified setting) is equiped with some \"protections\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The detailed functionning of these protections is out of the scope of this lecture, but the principle is rather simple. A protection is a piece of equipment that will automatically disconnect a powerline if it detects some danger.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this environment these \"protections\" will automatically disconnect some powerlines when:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the flow on the powerline is above the thermal limit for too long (3 consecutive steps)\n",
    "- the flow on the powerline is exceed twice the thermal limit (in this case the disconnection is instanteneous)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Margin on a powerline\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know the current is limited, we can properly define the \"margin\" on a powerline. The margin can be thought as the amount of current that the powerline can still transmit without any danger.\n",
    "\n",
    "More formally, if we denote by `i` the current on a given powerline and by `M` its thermal limit then the margin is defined as, for this environment as:\n",
    "```\n",
    "relative_flow = i / M\n",
    "raw_margin = 1 - i / M\n",
    "raw_margin_capped = max(0., raw_margin)  # to ensure the margin is between 0 and 1\n",
    "margin_powerline = raw_margin_capped^2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"reward\" of this game is then the sum of all the `margin_powerline` for all powerline of the grid. Note that if a powerline is disconnected, with this setting its margin is 1.0 (there is no powerflow on it) and if the powerline is on overflow (the flow `i` is equal or above the thermal limit `M`) the the margin is 0.0, which make sense because in this case, you can't have any more flows on this powerline.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3) Game over\n",
    "So now we have defined what we need to do: at any time we need to maximise the total margin of the grid. This corresponds to taking as less risk as possible during the powergrid operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Game over conditions\n",
    "But as we saw, a pretty simple \"policy\" would solve this problem very easily. As we explained above, when a powerline is disconnected from the grid, then the margin on this powerline is 1.0, which is the highest possible margin. The policy consisting in \"disconnecting every powerline\" would then be extremely efficient. This makes total sense: if everything is disconnected, the no power is flowing and everything is safe [this is often why I would recommend to switch off the house circuit breaker before trying to touch any powerplug in your house.]\n",
    "\n",
    "But this solution is not satisfactory. The goal of the powergrid is indeed to bring power to as much people / companies as possible. In our framework grid2op we modeled this phenomenon by introducing some \"game over\" criteria. And, when the game is over, you lost the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be perfectly exhaustive, there are 4 game over conditions for this environment at the moment:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a load is disconnected from the grid\n",
    "- a generator is disconnected from the grid\n",
    "- the grid is split into independant part\n",
    "- some technical conditions imposed by the solving of the powerflow equations (out of scope)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Operate in safety\n",
    "So as you see above, the \"game over conditions\" make the simple policy of disconnecting everything pretty useless. Because, well, it will game over at the first time step.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this environment, the objective is then to manage different scenarios, each representing a given day and avoid game over.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4) Action space\n",
    "So now, let's dive into the details of what your actions are.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this envrionment you are allowed to do two different things:\n",
    "\n",
    "- toggle the status of some powerlines: this means connecting or disconnecting some powerline\n",
    "- apply redispatching actions: adapt the production of the generators to solve the issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we'll detail what are exactly doing these actions, and how to implement them in the grid2op framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Modifying the status of the powerlines\n",
    "Powerlines can be switched on / off. We saw a bit earlier that they can be switched off by \"protections\" in case of overflow (see the section [Thermal limit and protections](#Thermal-limits-and-protections) for more information).\n",
    "\n",
    "But the agent can also willingly disconnect a powerline and of course, symmetrically, reconnect it.\n",

    "In this case this means that the flow on them is between 50% and 100% of their thermal limit. If a powerline were to appear red, this would means it's in overflow.\n",
    "On each powerline, the flows (given by default as a percentage of the thermal limit) is displayed near the powerline.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also notice some values on the generator: this is the amount of power they are producing, and some values on the load (negative) representing the values they are consuming.\n",

    "#### Redispatching\n",
    "Now that we saw how to disconnect some powerlines, let's see how to perform the other kind of actions available: the redispatching.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### What is redispatching\n",
    "But first, what is concretely redispatching? \n",
    "\n",
    "Redispatching is the fact to modify the schedule of generators (schedule that was planned usually the day before most of the time either by a central authority or by an economic market). \n",
    "\n",
    "This is done in a cumulative manner compared to what the real production should be.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example if \"someone\" (a central authority or a market) decided that generator 1 were to produce `77.1`MW at 00:10am and you decided at 00:05am to do a redispatching on this same generator of `+7.0`MW, then, the production of this generator at 00:10am will be `77.1MW [decided the day before by the market or a central authority] + (+7.0MW) [decided by you at 00:05am] = 84.1MW`.\n",

    "\n",
    "The main rules used for this environment are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **cooldown**: if you act on a powergrid, you have to wait a few number (3 in this case) of steps before you can act on the same powerline again\n",
    "- **restoration time**: if a powerline is disconnected because of the \"protections\" (see section [Thermal limits and protections](#Thermal-limits-and-protections) ) you have to wait 12 steps before you can reconnect it. This model the fact that in reality you have to send some team of people to inspect that the powerline can be safely set back into service.\n",
    "\n",
    "If an action would violate these rules, it is replaced by \"do nothing\" (see [Random Agent and operational constraints](#Random-Agent-and-operational-constraints) for a more detail explanation).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We remind also that the environment also takes into account some physical constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "Some powerline are disconnected when they are in overflow for too long, or when their overflow is too high (see section [Thermal limits and protections](#Thermal-limits-and-protections) ) and there is nothing the agent can do about that (beside of course reduce the flow on the concerned powerlines).\n",
