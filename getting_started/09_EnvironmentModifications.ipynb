    "To model the reality of powersystem operation and planning grid2op offers the possibility, when setting up an environment, to include powerline disconnection.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a really important part of the power system decision process. Indeed, when a powerline is being built it is often for more than a few decades (in some TSOs, some equipment was built and is still in service since almost 100 years ago!). Therefore, the **maintenance** of such equipment is important to model properly. In the case of grid2op, the **maitnenance** is modeled as a disconnection of a powerline and to block to reconnect this line for a given timespan. As this operation is planned you are given the relevant information in the observation:\n",
    "- [`obs.time_next_maintenance`](https://grid2op.readthedocs.io/en/master/observation.html#grid2op.Observation.BaseObservation.time_next_maintenance) will give you, for each powerline, in how many time steps this powerline will be disconnected from the grid\n",
    "- [`obs.duration_next_maintenance`](https://grid2op.readthedocs.io/en/master/observation.html#grid2op.Observation.BaseObservation.duration_next_maintenance) will give you, for each powerline, for how long (in number of time steps) this powerline will stay disconnected\n",
    "\n",
    "The other important property of the powergrid is that they cover large areas, usually, they are the side of a whole country/state, for example, counting hundreds of thousands of \"equipment\" (varying in size from the tiny screws to fix two things together to wide transformers of the size of a building...). The probability, in these conditions, that any of this equipment fails is far from neglectable. For the record, the \"failure\" of equipment can have dozens of possible causes; for instance, it can be in a bad shape (not enough maintenance), it suffers from natural external aggression (wind storm, struck by lightning bolts, a tree falls on it, the external temperature is too hot causing some thermal issues, etc.), be the victim of a malicious attack (a person hack a piece of software or physically attack the equipment with a bulldozer or a bombing for example), or it is not operated outside of its standard operation range (human error, bad data are sent to the control center, etc.), or any other cause you can imagine. However, most of these possible causes have a common consequence which is that one or more powerlines will be disconnected from the grid. This is what we call **hazards** in the grid2op framework. Compared to maintenance, **hazards** are not predictable (nothing, before it happens, indicates that there will be such hazards in the next few time steps).\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, in our framework, we also added the capability to explicitly model attacks on the grid. We call this feature **Opponent**. For now, we model the opponent as an entity that can take, at each time step, the decision to disconnect a powerline. It has the same effect as the **hazards** (you know what it will do before it is happening) but is different in the following sense:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **hazards** will refer to random unpredictable events (let's call it *natural failures*), they are, by essence, random\n",
    "- **attack** (the action performed by an Opponent) will refer to possibly adversarial attacks, targeting equipment (not necessarily at random).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases, you can know when a **maintenance**, a **hazard**, or an **attack** is happening if you look at the [`obs.time_before_cooldown_line`](https://grid2op.readthedocs.io/en/master/observation.html#grid2op.Observation.BaseObservation.time_before_cooldown_line) vector. It gives you, for each powerline, in how many time steps at **minimum** you need to wait before being able to reconnect a powerline. If this is 0 you can change its status. If this > 0 you need to wait for the appropriate number of time steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NB** whether it's an attack, a hazard, or maintenance, the powerline will be automatic *disconnected*. They will stay *disconnected* until you reconnect them. This entails that if you don't reconnect them, they will remain disconnected."
