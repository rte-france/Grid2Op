In next challenges, or for other usage of this platform where redispatching plays a role, it's better to consider the economic cost of the sytem. However, usually the cost is minimized, while the reward is maximized. To take this into account, a simplistic reward named \"EconomicReward\" has been created. It has the following property:\n",

It means if you ask to augment the production of generator 1 of $10MW$ at time step t, and of $20MW$ at time step $t+1$, it means the set point at time step $t+1$ will be $+30MW$ at this time step compared to a sate where no redispatching is made (it would have been of $+10MW$ if the second redispatching action were not performed).\n",

The setpoint of this generator at time t is $60MW$, and you want to increase its value of $40MW$. This action is legal: $60+40 \\leq pmax (=100) $. So at time $t$ everything is fine. Now let's suppose the environment also moved the setpoint of this same generator from $60$ to be at $70MW$ at time $t+1$. With the redispatching action, this would mean the setpoint asked is $70+40 = 110 > pmax$. This is not possible. In this case, the redispatching action will be capped. Among the desired redispatching of $+40$, only $+30$ will be implemented on the powergrid. \n",
    "- Another problem can arise with the fundamental principle of power grid: power energy cannot be stored on a grid. At each time we then have $\\sum \\text{Prod} = \\sum \\text{Load} + \\text{Losses}$. In this competition, the data are generated such that this condition holds (approximately) for all time steps. This means that if you ask a redispatching of +xxx MW on a given generator, then the other one must compensate and \"absorb\" xxx MW such that it sums at 0 overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Out of simplicity for the participants, there are some \"automaton\" that automatically transform an proposed redispatching action into a valid redispatching action. These automatons basically ensure that the two above-mentionned conditions hold. It explains the differences between \"target_redispatching\" which is the setpoint enter by the agent, and the \"actual_redispatching\" which what has been implemented on the powergrid after these automatons work."
