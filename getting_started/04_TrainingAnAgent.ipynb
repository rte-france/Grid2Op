    "### What's this ?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Grid2op package has been built with an \"object-oriented\" perspective: almost everything is encapsulated in a dedicated `class`. This allows for more customization of the plateform.\n",
    "\n",
    "The downside of this approach is that machine learning methods, especially in deep learning, often prefer to deal with vectors rather than with \"complex\" objects. Indeed, as we covered in the previous tutorials on the platform, we saw that building our own actions can be tedious and can sometime require important knowledge of the powergrid.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the contrary, in most of the standard Reinforcement Learning environments, actions have a higher level representation. For example in pacman, there are 4 different types of actions: \"turn left\", \"turn right\", \"go up\" and \"go down\". This allows for easy sampling (if you need to achieve an uniform sampling, you simply need to randomly pick a number between 0 and 3 included) and an easy representation: each action can be represented as a different component of a vector of dimension 4 [because there are 4 actions]. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, this representation is not \"human friendly\". It is quite convenient in the case of pacman because the action space is rather small, making it possible to remember which action corresponds to which component, but in the case of the grid2op package, there are hundreds or even thousands of actions. We suppose that we do not really care about this here, as tutorials on Reinforcement Learning with discrete action space often assume that actions are labeled with integers (such as in pacman for example).\n",
    "\n",
    "Converting grid2op actions into \"machine readable\" ones is the major difficulty as there is no unique ways to do so. In grid2op we offer some pre defined \"functions\" to do so:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `BoxGymObsSpace` will convert the action space into a gym \"Box\". It is rather straightforward, especially for **continuous** type of actions (such as *redispatching*, *curtailment* or actions on *storage units*). Representing the discrete actions (on powerlines and on substation) is not an easy task with them. We would not recommend to use them if your focus is on topology. More information on https://grid2op.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gym.html#grid2op.gym_compat.BoxGymActSpace\n",
    "- `MultiDiscreteActSpace` is similar to `BoxGymObsSpace` but mainly focused on the **discrete** actions (*lines status* and *substation reconfiguration*). Actions are represented with a gym \"MultiDiscrete\" space. It allows to perform any number of actions you want (which might be illegal) but comes with little restrictions. It handles continuous actions through \"binning\" (which is not ideal but doable). We recommend using this transformation if the algorithm you want to use is able to deal with \"MultiDiscrete\" gym action type. More information is given at https://grid2op.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gym.html#grid2op.gym_compat.MultiDiscreteActSpace\n",
    "- `DiscreteActSpace` is similar to `MultiDiscreteActSpace` in the sense that it focuses on **discrete** actions. It comes with a main restriction though: you can only do one action. For example, you cannot \"modify a substation\" AND \"disconnect a powerline\" with the same action. More information is provided at https://grid2op.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gym.html#grid2op.gym_compat.DiscreteActSpace. We recommend to use it if you want to focus on **discrete** actions and the algorithm you want to use is not able to deal with `MultiDiscreteActSpace`.\n",
    "- You can also fully customize the way you \"represent\" the action. More information is given in the notebook [11_IntegrationWithExistingRLFrameworks](11_IntegrationWithExistingRLFrameworks.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next section we will show an agent working with `DiscreteActSpace`. The code showed can be easily adapted with the other type of actions.\n",

    "\n",
    "After a few itérations of the \"l2rpn\" competitions it appears that the vast majority of top performers all rely on \"heuristics\" to handle the problem showed in grid2op.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, most of the time the \"agent\" does not take any actions when all the flows are bellow a certain threshold (say 90%) and only do actions when at least one powerline sees a flow above this limit. \n",
    "\n",
    "In `l2rpn_baselines` we embeded directly the possibility to have a \"gym environment\" that does some of these heuristics. For example, the \"gym environment\" keeps performing \"steps\" (with the do nothing action) while all the flows are bellow a certain threshold. Otherwise it asks for an action at the agent. In this setting, the agent is directly trained with the heuristics used at inference time.\n",

    "A few notes here:\n",
    "- the meta parameters (\"net_arch\", \"learning_rate\", \"n_steps\", \"gamma\", \"batch_size\", ...) are not fine tuned and are unlikely to lead to good results\n",
    "- the number of training steps is way too low (it should be much greater, probably in >= 1M)\n",
    "- there is no \"heuristics\" embeded here. Agents performs best when they act only when the grid is \"in danger\" (otherwise it takes a while for an agent to learn to \"do nothing\")\n",
    "- we use a \"test\" environment, this is why we specified \"test=True\" at the environment creation.\n",
    "- observations are not scaled\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these probably lead to a quite terrible agent...\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other important notes\n",
    "\n",
    "We do not recommend to train \"real\" model with such simple features. In particular, you might need to save (at different stage of training) your agent, log the progress using tensorboard (for example) etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be done with \"callbacks\" here that are not covered in this \"getting started\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "And now, it is time to test the agent that we trained on different scenarios (ideally) using another environment (to mimic a real process)\n",

    "1) we use the trained model, convert the other environment to a gym env, run the environment and ask for the neural network what it should od\n",
    "2) embed the trained neural network in a \"grid2op agent\" class and use the built grid2op runner transparently\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution 1) is to be preferred for \"quick and dirty\" tests. In all other cases we strongly recommend to use solution 2 as it also allows you to not recode the \"gym loop\" to benefit from the saving functionality (as so to be able to inspect your agent in grid2viz for example) etc.\n",
