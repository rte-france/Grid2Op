    "The Grid2op package has been built with an \"object-oriented\" perspective: almost everything is encapsulated in a dedicated `class`. This allows for more customization of the plateform.\n",
    "\n",
    "The downside of this approach is that machine learning methods, especially in deep learning, often prefer to deal with vectors rather than with \"complex\" objects. Indeed, as we covered in the previous tutorials on the platform, we saw that building our own actions can be tedious and can sometime require important knowledge of the powergrid.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the contrary, in most of the standard Reinforcement Learning environments, actions have a higher representation. For example in pacman, there are 4 different types of actions: turn left, turn right, go up and do down. This allows for easy sampling (if you need to achieve an uniform sampling, you simply need to randomly pick a number between 0 and 3 included) and an easy representation: each action can be represented as a different component of a vector of dimension 4 [because there are 4 actions]. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, this representation is not \"human friendly\". It is quite convenient in the case of pacman because the action space is rather small, making it possible to remember which action corresponds to which component, but in the case of the grid2op package, there are hundreds or even thousands of actions, making it impossible to remember which component corresponds to which action. We suppose that we do not really care about this here, as tutorials on Reinforcement Learning with discrete action space often assume that actions are labeled with integers (such as in pacman for example).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, to allow RL agent to train more easily, we allow to make some \"[Converters](https://grid2op.readthedocs.io/en/latest/converters.html)\" whose roles are to allow an agent to deal with a custom representation of the action space. The class [AgentWithConverter](https://grid2op.readthedocs.io/en/latest/agent.html#grid2op.Agent.AgentWithConverter) is perfect for such usage."
